# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having cross-platform versions, pipenv install will fail on a platform other than the one
#   used to generate the Pipfile.lock.
